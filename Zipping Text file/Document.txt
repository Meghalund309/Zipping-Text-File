In the below class we are storing the HashMap content in a hashmap.ser serialized file.
Once when we run the below code it would produce a hashmap.ser file. This file would be used in the next class for de-serialization.
The hashmap.ser serialised file can be Stored to any Location with describing it’s Location Like Below
So we need the Location to write the HashMap in it.
So for that need to Provide the External Location to Store the HashMap
In the below class we are storing the HashMap content in a hashmap.ser serialized file.
