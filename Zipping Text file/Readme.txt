Zipping Text File

Steps to run the program

1) Enter the correct file address.
	Like(C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Project_DSA\\Document)
(While copying the address there usually occurs single (\) so you have to make it double slash (\\) to execute the program successfully)

An encoded file will be saved on your laptop, and you can manually set the address of that encoded file. Just copy the address where you want to save that file paste it in code( Huff_tree class in variable "outputFilePath").

This program will not save the decoded file once the encoded file is decoded, it will be decoded on your command prompt.
